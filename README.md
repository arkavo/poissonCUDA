# poissonCUDA

This project is to discuss the advantages of using Parallel Programming to simulate the Poisson equation.
The first study will be to optimize a number of factors. We know that to solve the Poisson equation, we will have to use derivatives extensively. It is here, therefore that we turn our attention to.
